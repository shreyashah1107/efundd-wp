                <p>Safeguarding is used by Payment Institutions and E-Money Issuers to protect funds it holds in-trust for the beneficial use of underlying users in the event they were to go into liquidation. It ensures that the funds can only be used to complete the payment as instructed or, should that prove to be impossible, the funds are returned to the original payer.</p>
